Alt+/: Toggle recording mouse input

Alt+Backspace: Replay recording

360 / (recorded_x \* sensitivity) = yaw

game_2_sens = (game_1_sens \* game_1_yaw) / game_2_yaw

## TODO

- [ ] Reset recording with Alt+0
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Record game yaws to file
- [ ] Convert between game sensitivities
